      <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed that I write not as often as I want to, so I procrastinated and first relaunched my blog instead of writing.
It has a new design and some new functionality, also the posts have now images. The relaunch was, for me, some kind of
personal retrospective, where I read all my old posts and found out that I&amp;rsquo;m probably a better webmaster than a writer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed, that I had not much time to blog about something in the past months&amp;hellip;
One thing was, that we all need money, so I had to work very much. And as some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;m also studying in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
