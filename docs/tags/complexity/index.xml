      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring cloud config is a configuration management solution and part of the Spring ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to integrate and&#xA;use, but it has severe downsides from an architectural perspective. Also, I have seen many projects where&#xA;it was added just because &amp;ldquo;it is a thing&amp;rdquo; and even more often, it was used to solve or work around problems in the&#xA;software architecture or deployment for which it doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a real solution. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll point out some&#xA;conceptional issues and downsides of that project I have seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are (still) many people telling proudly, how complex their product is. There are job ads, explaining that you will&#xA;&amp;ldquo;create highly complex software&amp;rdquo;. These false signals, which I personally saw in many positions and projects, create a&#xA;potentially huge long-tail problem, not primarily for engineers, but for the product management and engineering team&#xA;lead. In this blogpost, I want to point out some of those impacts of advertising complexity&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
