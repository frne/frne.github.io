      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to developer maturity, I heard many tech recruiters and decision-makers saying: &amp;ldquo;We should only hire senior
devs.&amp;rdquo; This may be justified in some situations, projects, or teams, but I do not accept this statement as a general
premise. In this blog post, I want to highlight the benefits that juniors can bring to the team and encourage you to find
and foster new talent actively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In IT, there is a paradox when it comes to job titles. Somewhere along the way, the practice of linking job titles to a
candidate&amp;rsquo;s (desired) experience became established in large parts of the market. This then created the now famous and
omnipresent job titles like &amp;ldquo;Senior Software Engineer&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Professional DevOps Engineer&amp;rdquo;, etc. In this blog post, I would
like to explain the paradox around these designations and how I use them in the course of the talent search&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why complexity in software projects is bad (and you should not advertise it)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are (still) many people telling proudly, how complex their product is. There are job ads, explaining that you will
&amp;ldquo;create highly complex software&amp;rdquo;. These false signals, which I personally saw in many positions and projects, create a
potentially huge long-tail problem, not primarily for engineers, but for the product management and engineering team
lead. In this blogpost, I want to point out some of those impacts of advertising complexity&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>If pragmatism raises technical debt, call it oversimplification (rant)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;pragmatism&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pragmatic&amp;rdquo; is, in my personal opinion, the most
overrated word in agile development. Many people use this as a buzzword without
knowing what it means. I hear people saying &amp;ldquo;He solved that complex problem in
half an hour, he&amp;rsquo;s so pragmatic!&amp;rdquo; and think for myself &amp;ldquo;Yeah, but that &amp;lsquo;solution&amp;rsquo;
probably causes other devs three times more effort than a sustainable solution
would take.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
