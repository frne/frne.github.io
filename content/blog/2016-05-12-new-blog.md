You may have noticed, that I had not much time to blog about something in the past months...
One thing was, that we all need money, so I had to work very much. And as some of you know, I'm also studying in the evenings.

<!--more-->

Long story short, I've restarted blogging with a new engine and new design once again. Key is (not just to use new swag), 
to simplify blogging for me, so I can put more time in the articles and less in managing the blog itself. I'm not much 
of a frontend developer or a designer, so the design will maybe not impress you ;)

Technically, the new blog is based on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and you 
can find it on [frne.github.com](https://frne.github.com).

I will port some of the older articles and of course add new ones.

**Big news: Currently for hire!**

If you are looking a motivated Java/Scala dev in the area of Zurich (Switzerland), we maybe should talk ;)
