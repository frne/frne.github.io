Almost everyone knows it, the awkward job-interview... The job ad was good, the CV impresses, the first interview takes 
place. But from minute one something is strange. You're nervous, the other person is unappealing, expectations are 
unclear. In my opinion, many first interviews fail because of small mistakes. These clumsy misses can come from the 
employer or the candidate and often have a very big impact on the further application process. I will try to uncover 
some often-played "faux pas" from boths sides and how to avoid them.

First of all, I'm totally aware of the fact, that I'm mixing up perspectives here. Many points, after all, are true from
employer and candidate perspective, some not.

### Don't be Impressive

### Stop Over-CV-ing

### Don't ask unanswerable Questions

### Forgive us our Impatience
