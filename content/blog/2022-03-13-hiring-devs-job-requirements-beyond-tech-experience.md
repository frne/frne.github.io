The level or maturity of developers is often, and also in many job ads still equated with experience with a particular technology, programming language or framework. Very often even in the form of "X years of experience with Y". In my experience, technology knowledge is a prerequisite, but often only a small part of a developer's skillset. In this blogpost I would like to go into my personal "ranking" and my requirements for developers and thus make them more transparent.

First, I would like to emphasize that developer maturity is extremely difficult to evaluate. I even wrote a blog post in
this series about why I find the "senior" term in software development paradoxical:
