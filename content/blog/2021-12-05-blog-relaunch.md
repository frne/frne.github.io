I noticed that I write not as often as I want to, so I procrastinated and first relaunched my blog instead of writing. 
It has a new design and some new functionality, also the posts have now images. The relaunch was, for me, some kind of 
personal retrospective, where I read all my old posts and found out that I'm probably a better webmaster than a writer...

### New Domain [FrankNeff.com](https://www.frankneff.com)

I used to write mostly about code, why [franks.codes](https://www.franks.codes) was kind of a fitting domain and a good 
decision at that time. But this is not true anymore. As everyone does, I have changed the things I think and write about 
from pure coding towards connecting business, people, and technology.

Because of this and many other reasons, I decided to go live with the new domain **[www.frankneff.com](https://www.frankneff.com)**
and also rebrand my homepage and social profiles in this course. Because I'm swiss, and this was my very first own 
domain, [frankneff.ch](https://frankneff.ch) also redirects to this blog, but is otherwise unused.

### New Design

I have a new design. It is still simple and clean, but not so "nerdy" then the last one. I think it matches the new 
domain and content better but still supports readability. Tell me if you like it.

Also, the categories and tags have been cleaned up a bit, especially in the older posts, just as a housekeeping measure.

### Things which stay the same

- Still [hugo built](https://gethugo.io), but a newer version
- Still completely open-source on [github.com/frne/frne.github.io](https://github.com/frne/frne.github.io).
  Anyways, please don't steal my content without credit.
- Sadly, the content... There is no new content by the time writing this, but I have roughly 10 posts planned / in mind. 
  I just need to write them. [#procrastination](http://localhost:1313/tags/procrastination/)
