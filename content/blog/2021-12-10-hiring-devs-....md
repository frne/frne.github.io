Also, try to avoid technology specializations at least in the title. Since I have a developer background myself, the
topic is quite important to me. I value the right mindset, as well as solution finding strategies significantly higher
than the very American "X years of experience with Y".

On the subject of technology, however, there is a big "***but...***". Very many developers are searching on job portals
for the technology they want to work with, e.g. "Java Engineer". Here, it can be worthwhile to have "Java" in the title
of the advertisement, even if it's only because of the search placement. If there is some budget available, it may be
worth having different, targeted advertisements for the same role to be filled.
