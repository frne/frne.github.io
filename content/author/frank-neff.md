I see myself as a curious problem solver. On a life-long mission to enable people, improve tools and optimize processes, 
I build software to make things work. Moreover, I like to talk about technology and sharing know-how in a team to 
improve my own skills and empower others.

It's my passion to build great tech, with great people, to make things better.
