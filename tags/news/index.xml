      <description>You may have noticed, that I had not much time to blog about something in the past months&amp;hellip; One thing was, that we all need money, so I had to work very much. And as some of you know, I&amp;rsquo;m also studying in the evenings.
Long story short, I&amp;rsquo;ve restarted blogging with a new engine and new design once again. Key is (not just to use new swag), to simplify blogging for me, so I can put more time in the articles and less in managing the blog itself.</description>
