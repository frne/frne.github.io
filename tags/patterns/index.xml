      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, in school, there was a somehow funny situation: The prof was talking about object orientation and
patterns. He came up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle&#34;&gt;SRP&lt;/a&gt; but left out some
important others. I asked if we will talk about all GRASP and SOLID principles, because in my personal opinion, they are
part of &amp;ldquo;the basics&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His answer was not what is was expecting&amp;hellip; He told me to prepare a talk about those principles in front of the class.
And so did I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async class=&#39;speakerdeck-embed&#39; data-id=&#39;af913bec51cd412b8e6f2a1231bf89ed&#39; data-ratio=&#39;1.33333333333333&#39; src=&#39;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I submitted my slides to him yesterday, and now I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for approval. I have held talks at developer
meetups, conferences and in different companies, but never at school. Looks like maybe I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a substitute
teacher in the near future ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
